### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Analysis on how Sri Lanka had to a face a huge inflation by creating a statistical model that perfectly explains how the rapid change in socio-economic variables of
the country that made Sri Lanka in crisis. We determine how much these factors affected the GDP of the nation. 

### SOURCE OF DATA: 
#### Central Bank of Sri Lanka
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is the monetary authority of Sri Lanka. It was established in 1950 under the Monetary Law Act No.58 of 1949 (MLA), it is a
semi-autonomous body, and following the amendments to the MLA in December 2002, is governed by a five-member Monetary Board, comprising the Governor as
chairman, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning, and three members appointed by the President of Sri Lanka, on the recommendation of the
Minister of Finance, with the concurrence of the Constitutional Council.

#### DATA PREPARATION: 
Since the dataset was not available by referring to Central Bank of Sri Lanka from every sector, we had to choose the most affecting parameters. The parameters were in different csv files and were categorized by dates, we had to prepare dataset from scratch. The dataset has the information from the year 2016 –April to 2022-March. 

### Conclusion:
There is good reason to believe that Sri Lanka’s economic crisis could reach a resolution, and a pathway for future economic growth could emerge using the
aforementioned starting points. One reason for this is because Sri Lanka was already taking steps to reduce poverty in the decades preceding the COVID-19
pandemic, with a 5.2% reduction in the rate of poverty by 2016, the accomplishment of near-universal electricity and labor growth in non-farming
sectors. The next step then is to continue to reimburse farmers and improve farming technologies rather than stripping away the artificial fertilizer. With more
nuanced labor laws and democratic leadership, Sri Lanka’s economic crisis should disappear in time.
